# Setup

* Determine sides (single people vs multiple using teamwork)
* Determine environment and time (situation aspects)
* Determine difficulty (active from opposing team or passive with DC)
* Determine relevant skills for each participant

# Conduction

* Any attempt to harm transitions immediately to a conflict
* 3 successes are required for a side to win
* 2 successes are granted for succeeding with style
* Ties create some sort of twist
* Participants may attempt to create an advantage before each of their team's rolls
  * Nothing happens on a tie
  * Failure forfeits ability to participate in the roll (no roll or can't grant bonus)
