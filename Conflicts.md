# Setup

* Determine sides
* Determine environment and time
  * Situation aspects
  * Zones ("bigger than a house") and actor position within them
* Determine [turn order]()

# Conduction

* Conflict proceeds via exchanges until...
  * Participants transition to a Contest
  * One side's actors have all conceded or been taken out
* During each exchange each remaining actor takes a turn in turn order
* Actors may concede at any time that there are no unresolved die rolls (even out-of-turn after an attack is declared)
 
# Turn options
* Optionally move to a neighboring, unobstructed zone (before or after...)
* Choose one of the following:
  * Use an overcome action to move to another zone
    * Normal overcome outcomes apply
    * Does not need to be a neighboring zone (set DC accordingly)
    * May be obstructed
    * May be in addition to normal movement
  * Take a different action
  * Concentrate on defense (+2 to all defend rolls)
    
# Resolving attacks
* Attacker rolls attack, defender rolls defense
  * Another actor may opt to stand in for the defender if it makes sense
* Calculate shifts between attack and defense rolls
* If attacker succeeds, the defender must absorb the shifts by...
  * Taking one or more consequences, each reducing the successful roll's shifts
    * Actor who inflicted the consequence gets a free invocation against it
  * Taking stress of equal or greater value to the remaining shifts the corresponding stress track
  * Being taken out

# Conceding and being taken out
* Actors who have conceded or been taken out are out of the conflict, period
* Opposing side gets what they want (if you are the last actor on your side)
* When conceding:
  * You are allowed some say in your actor's conflict outcome ("left for dead instead" of "taken prisoner")
  * Gain one Fate point for conceding (after the conflict ends)
  * Gain one Fate point for every consequence gained (after the conflict ends)
* When taken out:
  * Your opponent chooses your actor's conflict outcome ("taken prisoner, no ifs or buts")
