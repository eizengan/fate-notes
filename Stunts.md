# Obtaining

* Each player's actor has 3 stunts by default
* Additional stunts may be purchased at character creation or a milestone at a cost one point of refresh

# Usage

* A stunt can:
  * add a new action to skill
  * add a bonus to action
  * create a rules exception
* ...but only:
  * for a particular action
  * in a particular situation
  * once per conflict, scene, or session
  * after paying a Fate point

# Balancing

* A stunt should be limited in scope enough to feel special when used, but not enough that they never come up in play
  * A stunt should never effectively supplant a skill
  * Most stunts should limit both the action and situation to which they apply
  * A stunt you can't imagine being relevant in play is too limited
