# Obtaining

* Each player's actor has 3 stunts by default
* Additional stunts may be purchased at character creation or a [milestone](Advancement.md) at a cost one point of refresh

# Usage

* A stunt can:
  * add a new [action](Skills.md#usage) to a skill
  * add a bonus to action
  * create a rules exception
* ...but only:
  * for a particular action
  * in a particular situation
  * once per [conflict](Conflicts.md), scene, or session
  * after paying a [Fate point](Fate_Points.md)
* Examples:
  * Adding a new action
    * Backstab: use dexterity to attack creatures which don't know you're there
    * Intimidate: spend a Fate point to use charisma to defend against an attack 
  * Adding a bonus:    
    * Conceptualization Expert: add +2 to perception when trying to reconstruct a scene after the fact
    * Suppressing Fire: on a successful attack with a fully automatic weapon create +2 DC opposition to movement in that zone until your next turn
  * Creating a rules exception:
    * Riposte: when you succeed with style on a defense roll you may forego your boost to inflict a 2-shift hit on the attacker
    * Persistence: once per session you may reroll an overcome action without invoking an aspect or paying a Fate point
    
# Balancing

* A stunt should be limited in scope enough to feel special when used, but not enough that they never come up in play
  * A stunt should never effectively supplant a skill
  * Most stunts should limit both the action and situation to which they apply
  * A stunt you can't imagine being relevant in play is too limited
