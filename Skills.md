# Allocation

* Two methods of initial allocation:
  * Pyramid (default): each skill level must contain fewer skills than the level below
  * Tower: each skill level may have no more skills than the level below
* Players start with pyramid/tower including 1/2 of the skills (rounding up)
* Skills are capped at starting max (determined by initial allocation)
* Upon advancement each skill level may have no more skills than the level below

# Extras

* An ordered list of skills grant you better place in combat turn order
  * Two skills (major and minor) by default
  * Determine order by comparing skills in order - first turn goes to the first highest number, and so on
* Some skills may grant extra stress boxes and consequence slots. By default these skills give:
  * 0: nothing
  * +1/+2: 3-point stress box
  * +3/+4: 3- and 4-point stress boxes
  * +5/...: 3- and 4-point stress boxes, minor consequence slot
