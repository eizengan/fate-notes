* Actors may collaborate on actions in two ways:
  * combining skills
    * all actors are participating equally
    * all actors are performing the exact same [action](Skills.md#usage)
    * make one roll at actor's collective highest bonus +1/actor with a bonus in the skill
    * [failure/success](Actions_Outcomes.md) is shared by participants
    * examples:
      * collectively searching for a hidden doorway
      * breaking down a gate with a battering ram
  * stacking advantages
    * one actor is performing the action
    * other actors are setting the one actor up to succeed
    * other actors create advantage as normal, giving free invocations to the one actor
    * examples:
      * distracting the guards while the thief picks a lock
      * holding a hostage down while their hands are bound
