# Stress

* Stress represents transient trauma (e.g. windedness from narrowly avoiding a blow)
* Stress is restored as soon as an actor has a chance to take a breather
* Typically stress will be restored directly after resolving the [conflict](Conflicts.md) in which it was caused

# Consequences

* Consequences represent lasting trauma (e.g. an injury from combat)
* Each counts as an additional [aspect](Aspects.md) for the actor until it is removed
* Recovering from a consequence requires:
  * A successful recovery [action](Skills.md#usage) (overcome obstacle)
    * DC is equal the number of shifts for that slot
    * Another actor can take the action if it makes sense
    * Success changes the consequence's name to show it healing (broken leg > stuck in a cast)
  * Time for the recovering consequence to fade
    * Mild recovers after a full scene
    * Moderate recovers after a full session
    * Severe recovers after a full scenario
    * If halfway through a session/scenario, then recovery happens halfway through the next

# Extreme consequences

* Only one may be taken between major milestones
* Absorbs 8 (or more?) shifts
* Replaces one of an actor's aspects (but not high concept)
* Represent an injury so bad it changes the course of an actor's life (no right arm)
* No recovery action, no rename while recovering
* Can be renamed at next [major milestone](Advancement.md) (no retaking previous aspect)
